You must answer each individual question with an essay that consists of a minimum of 100 words. Reflections Consider the tragic case of Tanya Rider, who was involved in a serious car accident while driving alone on her way to work. Her car skidded off the side of the road, proceeded down a steep embankment, and came to rest at the bottom of a deep ravine. She was discovered several days later, as rescuers followed the electronic trail that she had left behind. List the several ways in which digital communication was involved in the discovery and ultimate rescue of Tanya. Describe how these aspects were either helpful or not, in solving the case. [100 words minimum] On page 6, we are presented with Koan 2 , which states that, \"Perfection is normal.\" In other words, if a digital file is copied, then that copy will be an absolute perfect representation of the original, right down to the last bit. In the 1980's, when albums were distributed on cassette tapes, listeners had the ability to create copies of these tapes, using a technique called dubbing . However, the resulting sound quality from a copied tape was usually quite poor, so record companies permitted such duplications. Now that albums are released digitally, do you feel that listeners should uphold their duplication rights? Or, should there be an expectation for consumers of digital media to respect the intellectual property rights of content creators? Explain.

Along with the fundamentals of computing, you will learn to analyze data, create technology that has a practical impact, and gain a broader understanding of how computer science impacts people and society. The programming language used in this course is Python3 . Problem sets and labs are inspired by the real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. This course is designed for both beginner and expert programmers alike. Big Ideas The major areas of study in this AP Computer Science Principles course are organized around the following seven big ideas: Creativity: Investigating the innovations enabled by computing. Abstraction: A technique of reducing detail, to focus on broader concepts. Data and Information: Facilitating the creation of knowledge. Algorithms: Developing and expressing solutions to computational problems. Programming: The means by which problem solving is conducted. The Internet: The foundation of networking, communication and collaboration. Global Impact: Analyzing the societal changes brought about by computing. Reference Material Python for Everybody, Charles R. Severance. This will be the primary textbook used in this course. The entire textbook will be provided in PDF format for free. Five Steps to a Five: AP Computer Science Principles, 1st Edition, Julie Schacht Sway. This textbook goes into considerable detail regarding each of the big ideas that are covered in this course. Blown to Bits, 3rd Edition, Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, Harry Lewis. This textbook will be used to investigate some of the changes and impacts that modern computing systems have had on society as a whole. It will be provided to students in PDF format for free. Hardware Each student is required to bring their laptop computer to class. Windows, Mac OS and Linux operating systems are supported. Homework Homework assignments will be posted regularly on the class website. Students are required to download and complete the assignment in electronic form. Homework submission instructions will be described within the assignment overview. Students are expected to submit their homework before the due date. Late Policy If a student submits their homework within 24 hours after the due date has passed, I will impose a 50% grading penalty . After that time frame, the homework will be assigned a grade of 0 . Plagiarism Copying all or part of a programming solution, from another student, or from an Internet source, is a violation of the BNDS Academic Dishonesty Policy. Any assignment that has been found to be plagiarized will receive a grade of 0 . Grading Homework: Students are encouraged to put forth their best effort, even if the result does not compile, or produces an incorrect output. Students will receive partial credit in such cases. Labs: Students will be expected to demonstrate their programming proficiency by working through coding problems in class. Quizzes: Short 15 minute quizzes on current topics. These will be announced in advance. Tests: An extensive test of the topics covered in the section. Tests will be graded with partial credit, and carefully analyzed for understanding and general knowledge. Tests will consist of problems similar to examples covered in class and homework. Students will be informed of a test at least one week in advance. A missed test with and unexcused absence will receive a grade of 0. A missed test with an excused absence can be made up by appointment.
