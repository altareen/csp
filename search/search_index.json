Consider the tragic case of Tanya Rider, who was involved in a serious car accident while driving alone on her way to work. Her car skidded off the side of the road, proceeded down a steep embankment, and came to rest at the bottom of a deep ravine. She was discovered several days later, as rescuers followed the electronic trail that she had left behind.

On page 6, we are presented with Koan 2 , which states that, \"Perfection is normal.\" In other words, if a digital file is copied, then that copy will be an absolute perfect representation of the original, right down to the last bit. In the 1980's, when albums were distributed on cassette tapes, listeners had the ability to create copies of these tapes, using a technique called dubbing . However, the resulting sound quality from a copied tape was usually quite poor, so record companies permitted such duplications.

Easter Sunday is a holiday which falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon of Spring. This algorithm was discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss. The parameter year is the variable for the year in question. In the provided code, year takes on the value 2001 . Your program must perform the following calculations: Divide year by 19 and call the remainder a . Ignore the quotient. Divide year by 100 to get a quotient b and a remainder c . Divide b by 4 to get a quotient d and a remainder e . Divide (8 * b + 13) by 25 to get a quotient g . Ignore the remainder. Divide (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) by 30 to get a remainder h . Ignore the quotient. Divide c by 4 to get a quotient j and a remainder k . Divide (a + 11 * h) by 319 to get a quotient m . Ignore the remainder. Divide (2 * e + 2 * j - k - h + m + 32) by 7 to get a remainder r . Ignore the quotient. Divide (h - m + r + 90) by 25 to get a quotient n . Ignore the remainder.

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, September 20, 2019 Total Points: 10 In this lab, you must write a Python program that determines the user's interest in seeing a particular movie. Background Theory You interest in a movie depends upon the following two factors: The price of the movie's ticket, in dollars. The rating which the movie received, which can be any decimal number from 0 to 5, inclusive. Your level of interest in a movie is shown by the following indicators: extremely interested very interested moderately interested barely interested completely uninterested The following are the criteria upon which you make your movie viewing decisions. Hint: Implement these in Python using an if-elif-else code structure. You like bargains. Any movie that costs less than $5.00 is one that you are extremely interested in viewing, as long as that movie has received 2 or more stars. You dislike expensive movies. If a movie costs $12.00 or more, then you are completely uninterested in seeing it. However, if that movie happened to recieve 5 stars, then you are barely interested in seeing it. You enjoy high quality movies. You are very interested in seeing any movie that has a price below $12.00, and is rated greater than 4 stars. You are moderately interested in seeing any movie which costs between $5.00 and $11.99, as long as those movies received between 2 and 4 stars, inclusive. You dislike poorly rated movies. Any movie that has received less than 2 stars is one that you are barely interested in seeing, as long as it costs less than $5.00. If any movie falls outside of the previously mentioned criteria, then you are completely uninterested in seeing it. Note that the function selectfilm() returns the variable outcome .

Task Outline Due Date: Saturday, October 12, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change. Background Theory A greedy algorithm is one, \"that always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer.\" Suppose a cashier owes a customer some change, and that cashier wishes to minimize the quantity of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies that are dispensed to the customer. A greedy algorithm is one that would take, on each pass, the biggest bite out of this problem as possible. For example, if a customer is owed 41 cents, the biggest first(i.e., best immediate, or local) bite that can be taken is 25 cents. That bite is the \"best,\" as it gets us closer to 0 cents faster than any other coin would. Note that a bite of this size would reduce what was a 41 cent problem down to a 16 cent problem, since 41 - 25 = 16 . Another 25 cent bite would be too big, so our cashier would move on to a bite of size 10 cent, resulting in a 6 cent problem. At that point, the greedy algorithm calls for one 5 cent bite followed by one 1 cent bite, at which point the problem is solved. The result of this greedy algorithm is that the customer receives one quarter, one dime, one nickel, and one penny: four coins in total. Hints There are a few different ways in which this assignment can be solved. One of the ways is with a clever use of the integer division operator.

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, October 18, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that determines which gene is present in a DNA sequence. Background Theory DNA is often described as a double helix of molecules known as nucleotides . Only four DNA nucleotides exist, and they are known by the labels A, C, G, and T. This means that we can conveniently represent a DNA sequence with a Python text string. A cluster of three nucleotides is called a codon , and they represent amino acids which are present in DNA. For example, ATG is a codon which occurs throughout a DNA sequence. Codons are significant, because they are markers which indicate the presence of a gene . ATG is the start codon which marks the beginning of a gene sequence. All of the nucleotides which are present, right up to, and including the stop codon are part of the gene. Example Case Consider the following DNA sequence: ATATGTAGCTAGCATAATA The start codon is ATG , and the stop codon for this example is TAA . Note that there are 9 nucleotides between these codons: AT ATGTAGCTAGCATAA TA Therefore, the gene sequence which results from these codons is: ATGTAGCTAGCATAA Hints Note that we will not consider the case where a gene is absent from a DNA sequence.

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, September 23, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the frequency of a particular music note, given its octave and pitch class. Background Theory One of the oldest problems in music theory is how to map the notes of a musical piece to a set of audio frequencies. Your task is to write a Python program that performs a particular kind of mapping. First, we must define a form of musical note notation. One common way of accomplishing this is to use the octave pitch notation. This notation represents each note as a number pair, where the first number indicates which octave the note belongs to, and the second number indicates which semitone the pitch corresponds to. There are 12 semitone notes within each octave on the keyboard, as in the following diagram: octave pitch representations are written in decimal format. For example, the 5th octave and 9th semitone(corresponding to note A) would be written as: 5.9 In order to map a sound frequency to this octave pitch representation, we must begin by selecting a reference note. In the Western musical scale, we assign the frequency 440Hz to the octave pitch reference note of 4.9. This corresponds to the 4th octave, 9th semitone, which is note A. Our mapping must ensure that the same note in the next higher octave has double the frequency. In other words, 5.9 corresponds to 880Hz, and 3.9 corresponds to 220Hz. This mapping system assumes that each of the semitones within an octave is equally spaced, and this is known as a tempered scale. The formula we use to calculate the frequency from a given octave pitch note is as follows: frequency = ref * 2 ** (octa + (semi/12.0)) frequency : The result of the calculation, in Hertz. ref : The frequency of the reference note, which is: 440 Hertz. octa : The octave note minus the reference note, which is: octave - 4 semi : The pitch semitone minus the reference semitone, which is: pitch - 9 Code Distribution Description File Size File Name Python Source Code for Note Frequency 1.3KB pset03.zip Contents of pset03.zip : PSet03NoteFrequency/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 notefrequency.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 testnotefrequency.py Specification Write a Python program in the file notefrequency.py that calculates the frequency of a particular musical note, given its octave and pitch class.

Task Outline Due Date: Tuesday, October 8, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the quarterback rating, which is a measure of the performance of a quarterback, in the game of American football. Background Theory The game of American football is one of the more popular sports that is played in the U.S. The objective of the game is to advance the ball into a special region called the end zone. One of the more effective ways to accomplish this task, is for one of the players to throw the ball down the field. The player who is responsible for throwing the ball is called the quarterback. Throwing a football is a highly specialized skill, and some players are better at it than others. There is an equation which objectively evaluates how good a quarterback has performed during a particular game, based on a series of factors. This quarterback rating equation is based on the following four factors: completion percentage, yards per attempt, touchdowns per attempt, and interceptions per attempt. Each of those factors is scaled to a value between 0 and 2.375 . A description of each of these factors is as follows: Completion Percentage: This reflects the quantity of successful passes that the quarterback has made, compared with the number of attempted passes. a = (1.0*comps/attempts - 0.3) * 5 Yards Per Attempt: This indicates the number of yards that the quarterback has obtained by passing the football, compared with the number of attempted passes. b = (1.0*yards/attempts - 3) * 0.25 Touchdowns Per Attempt: This indicates the quantity of touchdowns that the quarterback has achieved, compared with the number of attempted passes. c = 20.0 * tdowns/attempts Interceptions Per Attempt: This details the number of times that an opposing player has inadvertently caught the football, compared with the number of attempted passes. An interception is also known as a pick. d = 2.375 - (25.0 * picks/attempts) The following is an explanation of the variables used in the above mentioned equations: attempts : The number of passing attempts. comps : The number of completions, or successful passes. yards : The quantity of yards gained by passing the football. tdowns : The number of touchdowns obtained by passing the football. picks : The number of interceptions, that is, when the football is caught by a member of the opposing team. Note: If the result of any one of the above equations is greater than 2.375 , then that factor is set to 2.375 . Also, if the result of any one of those equations is a negative number, then that factor is set to 0 .

Task Outline Due Date: Wednesday, October 16, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the amount of money that a customer will be billed, based on their water usage. Background Theory A water utility is responsible for supplying clean, fresh water to its customers in a given geographical area. The water utility will typically charge different rates for each category of customer. Supplying water to individual households is relatively straightforward, so they are charged minimal rates. However, commercial and industrial factories may require massive amounts of water, so they are charged more for the necessary supporting infrastructure. A customer's water bill depends on how many gallons of water they consumed during a particular billing period. A water meter is used to determine a customer's water consumption. It consists of a dial that has nine digits. However, note that the final digit in the dial records one-tenth of a gallon . In other words, if the water meter reads 923874345 then this corresponds to 92387434.5 gallons. The water meter is read once at the beginning of the billing period, and then once and the end. A customer's water consumption, in gallons, is computed from the difference in these two meter readings. Customer Categories There are three categories of customer: residential , commercial , and industrial . The following is the fee schedule for each of these categories: residential A base rate of $5.00, plus $0.0005 per gallon used. commercial A base rate $1000.00 for 40000 gallons or less, plus $0.00025 for each additional gallon used. industrial A base rate of $1000.00 for 40000 gallons or less. A base rate of $2000.00 if usage exceeds 40000 gallons, but does not exceed 80000 gallons. A base rate of $3000.00 plus $0.00025 for each additional gallon if usage exceeds 80000 gallons. Hints Note that the meter's dial has nine digits and records the tenths of a gallon. For example, if the beginning reading was 444400003 and the ending reading was 444400135 , then the customer used 13.2 gallons of water during that billing period. We won't consider the case where the water meter \"flips over\" from 999999999 to 000000000 .

Task Outline Due Date: Wednesday, October 23, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that dispenses the correct amount of change, depending on the stock of coins in the machine. Background Theory You will write a program that simulates the behaviour of a coin-operated vending machine, a device that was in common use until recently. A vending machine operates as follows: A customer selects an item for purchase, then inserts a certain amount of cash to cover the cost of the item. The product is then dispensed, and if change is due to the customer, it is provided in the form of coins. The vending machine we will consider has a finite stock of the following coins: 25 cents(quarters) , 10 cents(dimes) , and five cents(nickels) . Note that pennies will be excluded from consideration. The amount of change due to a customer is calculated according to the following simple relation: change = payment - cost . The vending machine should then dispense the minimum quantity of coins necessary to provide the change to the customer. However, what would happen if the machine completely ran out of a particular coin denomination, for instance, the quarter? In that case, the machine would have to fulfill its obligation by using its remaining stock of dimes and nickels. Note that the output of this program should be the quantity of coins that are dispensed by the vending machine. Example Case Consider the case where a customer deposits 200 cents into a vending machine, to purchase a product costing 70 cents. The change due to the customer is 130 cents. Then, let's say that the vending machine has a coin stock of 3 quarters, 3 dimes and 10 nickels. The vending machine will then dispense 3 quarters, 3 dimes and 5 nickels to the customer, which is 11 coins in total. Your program should return 11 as its result. Hints Assume that the customer always deposits paper currency as payment. In other words, the payment placed into the vending machine does not replenish the coin stocks. Every time you dispense a coin to the customer, reduce that coin stock by one. The cost of the products, and the payment deposited, are all denominated in cents . This greatly simplifies the programming involved. You must calculate the minimum quantity of coins possible to fulfill the amount of change due to the customer. We won't consider the case where the vending machine has an insufficient stock of coins to cover the amount of change due to the customer. There will always be enough coins in each case.

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, November 4, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that determines how many months it will take to save up enough money for a down payment on a house. Background Theory Let's assume that you have grown weary of living in dormitories, and you wish to save up enough money for a down payment on a house. The down payment is 25% of the the total cost of the house. Since housing is very expensive, it will probably take you several years to accomplish this task. In this program, we will measure this time duration in terms of months. Let's also assume that you have a well-paying job, in which you earn a respectable annual salary. As well, you have a savings account which generates an annual rate of return. Furthermore, your place of employment provides you with pay raises on a semi-annual basis. That is, your salary will increase by a certain decimal percentage after the 6th month, the 12th month, the 18th month, and so on. Parameters The following is an explanation of the parameters used in the savingsduration() function: annualsalary This is the annual salary which you earn from your job. percentsaved This is the amount of your salary which you will dedicate towards saving for the down payment. It should be expressed in decimal form, for example: 0.1 totalcost This is the purchase price of your dream home. payraise This is the amount by which your salary is increased, and these raises occur every six months. This should be expressed in decimal form, for example: 0.1 Hints You will need to determine the amount of the down payment , which can be calculated from: totalcost*0.25 Since the time duration is measured in months, you will need to determine your monthly salary . This can be calculated from: annualsalary/12.0 The amount that you have saved so far should be referred to as your current savings , and you begin with a current savings of: 0 Assume that your savings account generates an annual rate of return of 4%. In other words, rate = 0.04 Create a variable that keeps track of the number of months that have occurred in this simulation, and set this variable to: 0 Assume that you invest your current savings wisely, so at the end of each month, you receive an additional currentsavings*rate/12.0 to be put into your savings.
