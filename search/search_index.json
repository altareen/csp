Description File Size File Name Explore Task Comprehensive Guide 318KB exploreTaskComprehensiveGuide.pdf Task Outline Due Date: Monday, March 2nd, 2020 Total Points: 30 In this project, you will be expected to conduct an investigation on a computing innovation that can potentially have significant effects on our society, economy, or culture. Those effects may be beneficial, but they can also be harmful. You will submit your Explore Task as two separate parts: the computational artifact and the written response. Background Theory You should choose an innovation that consumes, transforms, or produces data in one form or another. Also, the innovation should raise at least one concern in terms of its security, privacy, or storage. You will need to research the innovation, evaluating sources along the way for their relevance, credibility, and accessibility. You should also take care to avoid plagiarism by appropriately citing all sources used. Your investigation should not simply collect facts. Instead, it should delve deeply into the computing innovation by asking questions, proposing solutions, and drawing thoughtful conclusions. This deep reflection will lead to your creation of a computational artifact that illustrates, represents, or explains the computing innovation's intended purpose, function, or effects. You should strive for a creative and engaging artifact that shows your ability to think outside traditional avenues for communicating ideas. This could be an animated video, an infographic, a song, or anything else that highlights both the task and your creativity.

Background Due Date: Thursday, September 12, 2019 Total Points: 10 In this lab, you must write a Python program that determines which particular day and month that Easter Sunday appears. Code Distribution Description File Size File Name Python Source Code for Easter Sunday 1.2KB lab02.zip Contents of lab02.zip : Lab02EasterSunday/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 eastersunday.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 testeastersunday.py Specification Write a Python program in the file eastersunday.py that computes the date of Easter Sunday, given a particular year. Easter Sunday is a holiday which falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon of Spring. This algorithm was discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss. The parameter year is the variable for the year in question. In the provided code, year takes on the value 2001 . Your program must perform the following calculations: Divide year by 19 and call the remainder a . Ignore the quotient. Divide year by 100 to get a quotient b and a remainder c . Divide b by 4 to get a quotient d and a remainder e . Divide (8 * b + 13) by 25 to get a quotient g . Ignore the remainder. Divide (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) by 30 to get a remainder h . Ignore the quotient. Divide c by 4 to get a quotient j and a remainder k . Divide (a + 11 * h) by 319 to get a quotient m . Ignore the remainder. Divide (2 * e + 2 * j - k - h + m + 32) by 7 to get a remainder r . Ignore the quotient. Divide (h - m + r + 90) by 25 to get a quotient n . Ignore the remainder.

Background Theory A greedy algorithm is one, \"that always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer.\" Suppose a cashier owes a customer some change, and that cashier wishes to minimize the quantity of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies that are dispensed to the customer. A greedy algorithm is one that would take, on each pass, the biggest bite out of this problem as possible. For example, if a customer is owed 41 cents, the biggest first(i.e., best immediate, or local) bite that can be taken is 25 cents. That bite is the \"best,\" as it gets us closer to 0 cents faster than any other coin would. Note that a bite of this size would reduce what was a 41 cent problem down to a 16 cent problem, since 41 - 25 = 16 . Another 25 cent bite would be too big, so our cashier would move on to a bite of size 10 cent, resulting in a 6 cent problem. At that point, the greedy algorithm calls for one 5 cent bite followed by one 1 cent bite, at which point the problem is solved. The result of this greedy algorithm is that the customer receives one quarter, one dime, one nickel, and one penny: four coins in total.

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, October 18, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that determines which gene is present in a DNA sequence. Background Theory DNA is often described as a double helix of molecules known as nucleotides . Only four DNA nucleotides exist, and they are known by the labels A, C, G, and T. This means that we can conveniently represent a DNA sequence with a Python text string. A cluster of three nucleotides is called a codon , and they represent amino acids which are present in DNA. For example, ATG is a codon which occurs throughout a DNA sequence. Codons are significant, because they are markers which indicate the presence of a gene . ATG is the start codon which marks the beginning of a gene sequence. All of the nucleotides which are present, right up to, and including the stop codon are part of the gene. Example Case Consider the following DNA sequence: ATATGTAGCTAGCATAATA The start codon is ATG , and the stop codon for this example is TAA . Note that there are 9 nucleotides between these codons: AT ATGTAGCTAGCATAA TA Therefore, the gene sequence which results from these codons is: ATGTAGCTAGCATAA Hints Note that we will not consider the case where a gene is absent from a DNA sequence.

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, November 1, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that smoothes an audio signal by averaging a list of integers. Background Theory An audio signal is sometimes stored as a list of integer values. The values represent the intensity of the signal at successive time intervals. Of course, in a program, the signal is represented with a list. Often, a small amount of noise is included in the signal. Noise is usually small, momentary changes in the signal level. An example is the static that is heard in addition to the signal in AM radio. Smoothing a signal removes some of the noise, and improves the perceptual quality of the signal. This assignment requires you to smooth the values in a list of integers. Hints First, you should create a result list called smooth , which has exactly the same size as the audio list. Recall that the multiplication operator can be used to create a list which is initialized with zeroes: smooth = [0] * len(audio) The first element of the smooth list is a special case, because it should be calculated from the average of the first two elements of the audio list. The last element of the smooth list is also a special case, because it should be calculated from the average of the last two elments of the audio list. The internal elements of the smooth list can be calculated from a for loop in the following manner. First, you will need to determine the boundaries of this loop. You should probably begin at index 1 , and go up to index len(audio)-1 . Recall that the for loop has the following variation: for i in range(start, stop): This means that the loop will begin at start , and go up to(but not include) stop .

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, November 8, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that encrypts a message using the caesar cipher. Background Theory The main idea behind the Caesar Cipher is to shift each letter in a secret message by a fixed number of positions. If this shifting behaviour goes further than the end of the alphabet, then it wraps around to the beginning, and continues from there. The security of this crypto-system relies on having only the sender and the recipient know the secret key , which is the number of places by which the letters have been shifted. Hints Python uses a numerical ASCII value to represent each text character in the alphabet. For example, the ASCII value of the letter \"a\" is 97 , and the ASCII value of the letter \"z\" is 122 . In order to convert between the two formats, you need to use the following Python functions: ord(txt) This returns the numerical ASCII code corresponding to the text character txt . chr(num) This returns the text character corresponding to the numerical ASCII code num . You will need to make an adjustment to the numerical output of ord(txt) , such that \"a\" corresponds to 0 , \"b\" corresponds to 1 , etc. Unencrypted text is generally called plaintext , and encrypted text is generally known as ciphertext . The quantity by which the letters have been shifted is called a key . In general, the Caesar Cipher encrypts messages by rotating each letter by key positions. More formally, p is the ASCII value of a letter in the plaintext, and key is the amount by which each letter is shifted, then the ASCII value of the corresponding letter in the ciphertext c , is computed by the following equation: c = (p + \\mbox{key})\\, \\mbox{mod}\\, 26 c = (p + \\mbox{key})\\, \\mbox{mod}\\, 26 You may assume that all of the characters in the plaintext messages are in lowercase .

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, November 15, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that decrypts a message using the polybius cipher. Background Theory The Polybius Square is an ancient Greek invention, discovered by a scholar named Polybius. It consists of a 5 by 5 grid, in which each square of the grid is filled in by a single letter. In this programming assignment, the grid has been enlarged to 6 by 6, so that it can accommodate the digits 0-9, as well as all the alphabet letters. Each letter in the grid can be represented by the two numbers that indicate its position in the grid. The first number denotes the specific row, and the second number denotes the column. In this manner, the letter \"q\" would be encoded by the digits 24 . Even though this method of encryption seems feasible, it is not very secure. We need to introduce the notion of a key , in order to increase the security of this encryption system. We can achieve this by simply re-ordering the placement of the alphabet and digits, before inserting them into the grid. In this updated version of the grid, the letter \"q\" would be encoded by the digits 45 . Decrypting a message is quite easy, simply use the pairs of numbers to locate each plaintext letter in the grid. For example, the number sequence \"0520020214\" can be decoded to the word \"hello\" . Hints You will notice that you are not given a sequence of numbers to decode. Instead, you are provided with a series of letters. Upon close inspection, you should notice that the provided letters consist of the symbols \"a\" , \"b\" , \"c\" , \"d\" , \"e\" and \"f\" . Each of the letter symbols corresponds to a row or column number in the polybius grid. Specifically, \"a\" = 0 , \"b\" = 1 , \"c\" = 2 , \"d\" = 3 , \"e\" = 4 and \"f\" = 5 . Your first task is to transform these letter symbols into their corresponding number symbols. Recall that, in order to convert from an ASCII format to a number, you need to use the following Python function: ord(txt) This returns the numerical ASCII code corresponding to the text character txt . Then, you will need to make an adjustment to the numerical output of ord(txt) , such that \"a\" corresponds to 0 , \"b\" corresponds to 1 , etc. Make sure that your resulting number sequence is in a string format. Then, you must separate out pairs of digits from this number sequence, and perform a lookup in the two-dimensional key grid. The first number from the pair corresponds to the the row, and the second digit corresponds to the column.

Background Theory In a substitution cipher, we encrypt a message by replacing every letter in a plaintext message with some other letter. In order to perform this encryption, we make use of a key . In the case of the substitution cipher, the key is a mapping of each of the letters of the alphabet to the letter that it should correspond to, when we encrypt it. To decrypt the message, the receiver of the message would need to know the key, so that they could reverse the process. A key , for example, might be the string jtrekyavogdxpsncuizlfbmwhq . This 26-character key means that a (the first letter of the alphabet) should be converted into j (the first letter of the key). Similarly, the letter b (the second letter of the alphabet) should be converted into t (the second letter of the key) and so on.

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, November 29, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that determines the validity of an HTTP request line. Background Theory HyperText Transfer Protocol(HTTP) is the protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other over the Internet. HTTP is an application level protocol, because it sits on top of the TCP layer in the protocol stack, and it is used by specific applications to talk to each other. In this particular case, those applications happen to be web browsers and web servers. HTTP is a connectionless, text-based protocol, in which clients send requests to servers. When you type a URL into a web browser, the following steps occur: If the URL contains a domain name, then the browser first connects to a Domain Name Server, and retrieves the corresponding IP address for that domain name. The web browser then connects to the web server, and sends an HTTP request for the desired web page. The HTTP request takes the following form: GET /hello.html HTTP/1.1 The web server receives the request, verifies that it is properly formatted, and returns an appropriate error message if it is not. Then, it checks for the desired web page. If the requested page exists, then the web server sends it out. However, if the web server cannot find the requested web page, then it will send out an error message. Example Case According to Regulation rfc7230 from the Internet Enginering Task Force(IETF), a well-formed HTTP request line takes the following form: delivery-method SPACE request-target SPACE HTTP-version Your task is to verify that a given HTTP request conforms to this structure, and is consistent with the following rules: If delivery-method is not GET , then the function should return: 405 Method Not Allowed If request-target does not begin with a / , then the function should return: 501 Not Implemented If request-target contains a \" , then the function should return: 400 Bad Request If HTTP-version is not HTTP/1.1 , then the function should return: 505 HTTP Version Not Supported If none of the above errors occur, then this means that the HTTP request line is well-formed, and that the parse() function should return the request-target . Hints You should use string slicing to separate the different parts of the request line. However, this means that you will need to discover the index locations of the SPACE s.

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, September 23, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the frequency of a particular music note, given its octave and pitch class. Background Theory One of the oldest problems in music theory is how to map the notes of a musical piece to a set of audio frequencies. Your task is to write a Python program that performs a particular kind of mapping. First, we must define a form of musical note notation. One common way of accomplishing this is to use the octave pitch notation. This notation represents each note as a number pair, where the first number indicates which octave the note belongs to, and the second number indicates which semitone the pitch corresponds to. There are 12 semitone notes within each octave on the keyboard, as in the following diagram: octave pitch representations are written in decimal format. For example, the 5th octave and 9th semitone(corresponding to note A) would be written as: 5.9 In order to map a sound frequency to this octave pitch representation, we must begin by selecting a reference note. In the Western musical scale, we assign the frequency 440Hz to the octave pitch reference note of 4.9. This corresponds to the 4th octave, 9th semitone, which is note A. Our mapping must ensure that the same note in the next higher octave has double the frequency. In other words, 5.9 corresponds to 880Hz, and 3.9 corresponds to 220Hz. This mapping system assumes that each of the semitones within an octave is equally spaced, and this is known as a tempered scale. The formula we use to calculate the frequency from a given octave pitch note is as follows: frequency = ref * 2 ** (octa + (semi/12.0)) frequency : The result of the calculation, in Hertz. ref : The frequency of the reference note, which is: 440 Hertz. octa : The octave note minus the reference note, which is: octave - 4 semi : The pitch semitone minus the reference semitone, which is: pitch - 9 Code Distribution Description File Size File Name Python Source Code for Note Frequency 1.3KB pset03.zip Contents of pset03.zip : PSet03NoteFrequency/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 notefrequency.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 testnotefrequency.py Specification Write a Python program in the file notefrequency.py that calculates the frequency of a particular musical note, given its octave and pitch class.

Task Outline Due Date: Tuesday, October 8, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the quarterback rating, which is a measure of the performance of a quarterback, in the game of American football. Background Theory The game of American football is one of the more popular sports that is played in the U.S. The objective of the game is to advance the ball into a special region called the end zone. One of the more effective ways to accomplish this task, is for one of the players to throw the ball down the field. The player who is responsible for throwing the ball is called the quarterback. Throwing a football is a highly specialized skill, and some players are better at it than others. There is an equation which objectively evaluates how good a quarterback has performed during a particular game, based on a series of factors. This quarterback rating equation is based on the following four factors: completion percentage, yards per attempt, touchdowns per attempt, and interceptions per attempt. Each of those factors is scaled to a value between 0 and 2.375 . A description of each of these factors is as follows: Completion Percentage: This reflects the quantity of successful passes that the quarterback has made, compared with the number of attempted passes. a = (1.0*comps/attempts - 0.3) * 5 Yards Per Attempt: This indicates the number of yards that the quarterback has obtained by passing the football, compared with the number of attempted passes. b = (1.0*yards/attempts - 3) * 0.25 Touchdowns Per Attempt: This indicates the quantity of touchdowns that the quarterback has achieved, compared with the number of attempted passes. c = 20.0 * tdowns/attempts Interceptions Per Attempt: This details the number of times that an opposing player has inadvertently caught the football, compared with the number of attempted passes. An interception is also known as a pick. d = 2.375 - (25.0 * picks/attempts) The following is an explanation of the variables used in the above mentioned equations: attempts : The number of passing attempts. comps : The number of completions, or successful passes. yards : The quantity of yards gained by passing the football. tdowns : The number of touchdowns obtained by passing the football. picks : The number of interceptions, that is, when the football is caught by a member of the opposing team. Note: If the result of any one of the above equations is greater than 2.375 , then that factor is set to 2.375 . Also, if the result of any one of those equations is a negative number, then that factor is set to 0 .

Task Outline Due Date: Wednesday, October 16, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the amount of money that a customer will be billed, based on their water usage. Background Theory A water utility is responsible for supplying clean, fresh water to its customers in a given geographical area. The water utility will typically charge different rates for each category of customer. Supplying water to individual households is relatively straightforward, so they are charged minimal rates. However, commercial and industrial factories may require massive amounts of water, so they are charged more for the necessary supporting infrastructure. A customer's water bill depends on how many gallons of water they consumed during a particular billing period. A water meter is used to determine a customer's water consumption. It consists of a dial that has nine digits. However, note that the final digit in the dial records one-tenth of a gallon . In other words, if the water meter reads 923874345 then this corresponds to 92387434.5 gallons. The water meter is read once at the beginning of the billing period, and then once and the end. A customer's water consumption, in gallons, is computed from the difference in these two meter readings. Customer Categories There are three categories of customer: residential , commercial , and industrial . The following is the fee schedule for each of these categories: residential A base rate of $5.00, plus $0.0005 per gallon used. commercial A base rate $1000.00 for 40000 gallons or less, plus $0.00025 for each additional gallon used. industrial A base rate of $1000.00 for 40000 gallons or less. A base rate of $2000.00 if usage exceeds 40000 gallons, but does not exceed 80000 gallons. A base rate of $3000.00 plus $0.00025 for each additional gallon if usage exceeds 80000 gallons. Hints Note that the meter's dial has nine digits and records the tenths of a gallon. For example, if the beginning reading was 444400003 and the ending reading was 444400135 , then the customer used 13.2 gallons of water during that billing period.

Task Outline Due Date: Wednesday, October 23, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that dispenses the correct amount of change, depending on the stock of coins in the machine. Background Theory You will write a program that simulates the behaviour of a coin-operated vending machine, a device that was in common use until recently. A vending machine operates as follows: A customer selects an item for purchase, then inserts a certain amount of cash to cover the cost of the item. The product is then dispensed, and if change is due to the customer, it is provided in the form of coins. The vending machine we will consider has a finite stock of the following coins: 25 cents(quarters) , 10 cents(dimes) , and five cents(nickels) . Note that pennies will be excluded from consideration. The amount of change due to a customer is calculated according to the following simple relation: change = payment - cost . The vending machine should then dispense the minimum quantity of coins necessary to provide the change to the customer. However, what would happen if the machine completely ran out of a particular coin denomination, for instance, the quarter? In that case, the machine would have to fulfill its obligation by using its remaining stock of dimes and nickels. Note that the output of this program should be the quantity of coins that are dispensed by the vending machine. Example Case Consider the case where a customer deposits 200 cents into a vending machine, to purchase a product costing 70 cents. The change due to the customer is 130 cents. Then, let's say that the vending machine has a coin stock of 3 quarters, 3 dimes and 10 nickels. The vending machine will then dispense 3 quarters, 3 dimes and 5 nickels to the customer, which is 11 coins in total. Your program should return 11 as its result. Hints Assume that the customer always deposits paper currency as payment. In other words, the payment placed into the vending machine does not replenish the coin stocks. Every time you dispense a coin to the customer, reduce that coin stock by one. The cost of the products, and the payment deposited, are all denominated in cents . This greatly simplifies the programming involved. You must calculate the minimum quantity of coins possible to fulfill the amount of change due to the customer.

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, November 4, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that determines how many months it will take to save up enough money for a down payment on a house. Background Theory Let's assume that you have grown weary of living in dormitories, and you wish to save up enough money for a down payment on a house. The down payment is 25% of the the total cost of the house. Since housing is very expensive, it will probably take you several years to accomplish this task. In this program, we will measure this time duration in terms of months. Let's also assume that you have a well-paying job, in which you earn a respectable annual salary. As well, you have a savings account which generates an annual rate of return. Furthermore, your place of employment provides you with pay raises on a semi-annual basis. That is, your salary will increase by a certain decimal percentage after the 6th month, the 12th month, the 18th month, and so on. Parameters The following is an explanation of the parameters used in the savingsduration() function: annualsalary This is the annual salary which you earn from your job. percentsaved This is the amount of your salary which you will dedicate towards saving for the down payment. It should be expressed in decimal form, for example: 0.1 totalcost This is the purchase price of your dream home. payraise This is the amount by which your salary is increased, and these raises occur every six months. This should be expressed in decimal form, for example: 0.1 Hints You will need to determine the amount of the down payment , which can be calculated from: totalcost*0.25 Since the time duration is measured in months, you will need to determine your monthly salary . This can be calculated from: annualsalary/12.0 The amount that you have saved so far should be referred to as your current savings , and you begin with a current savings of: 0 Assume that your savings account generates an annual rate of return of 4%. In other words, rate = 0.04 Create a variable that keeps track of the number of months that have occurred in this simulation, and set this variable to: 0 Assume that you invest your current savings wisely, so at the end of each month, you receive an additional currentsavings*rate/12.0 to be put into your savings.

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, November 11, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that validates ISBN-10 numbers. Background Theory Any book that you purchase has an International Standard Book Number , otherwise known as an ISBN or ISBN-10 . This is a 10-digit number that uniquely identifies books and media products published internationally. It turns out that the last number of an ISBN-10 's digits is a check digit, otherwise known as a checksum, which is a number related mathematically to its preceding digits. The digits of an ISBN-10 are supposed to adhere to a formula, and this check digit allows you to verify whether an ISBN-10 's other nine digits are valid, without having to resort to other means of verification, for instance, by performing a query on a database of books. Calculating the Check Digit The check digit of an ISBN-10 number can be defined as follows. If x_1 x_1 represents an ISBN-10 's first digit, and x_{10} x_{10} represents its last digit, then we have the following: x_{10} = (1 \\cdot x_1 + 2 \\cdot x_2 + 3 \\cdot x_3 + 4 \\cdot x_4 + 5 \\cdot x_5 + 6 \\cdot x_6 + 7 \\cdot x_7 + 8 \\cdot x_8 + 9 \\cdot x_9)\\, \\mbox{modulus}\\, 11 x_{10} = (1 \\cdot x_1 + 2 \\cdot x_2 + 3 \\cdot x_3 + 4 \\cdot x_4 + 5 \\cdot x_5 + 6 \\cdot x_6 + 7 \\cdot x_7 + 8 \\cdot x_8 + 9 \\cdot x_9)\\, \\mbox{modulus}\\, 11 In other words, to compute an ISBN-10 's tenth digit, multiply its first digit by 1, its second digit by 2, its third digit by 3, its fourth digit by 4, its fifth digit by 5, its sixth digit by 6, its seventh digit by 7, its eighth digit by 8, and its ninth digit by 9. Take the sum of those products and perform a modulus with 11. The result should be the ISBN-10 's tenth digit. Example Case For example, the ISBN-10 for the textbook Absolute Beginner's Guide to C , is 0-789-75198-4 , the tenth digit of which is 4 . Let's take the sum of the products of the ISBN-10 's first nine digits: (1 \\cdot \\texttt{0}) + (2 \\cdot \\texttt{7}) + (3 \\cdot \\texttt{8}) + (4 \\cdot \\texttt{9}) + (5 \\cdot \\texttt{7}) + (6 \\cdot \\texttt{5}) + (7 \\cdot \\texttt{1}) + (8 \\cdot \\texttt{9}) + (9 \\cdot \\texttt{8}) = 290 (1 \\cdot \\texttt{0}) + (2 \\cdot \\texttt{7}) + (3 \\cdot \\texttt{8}) + (4 \\cdot \\texttt{9}) + (5 \\cdot \\texttt{7}) + (6 \\cdot \\texttt{5}) + (7 \\cdot \\texttt{1}) + (8 \\cdot \\texttt{9}) + (9 \\cdot \\texttt{8}) = 290 If we now compute 290 modulus 11, we get a result of 4, which is equal to the tenth digit in the ISBN-10 . This verifies that the ISBN-10 number is legitimate. Hints Note that the ISBN-10 is being read in as a string, and it gets converted to an integer by using the int() function. The reason for this procedure is to accommodate ISBN-10 's with leading zeros. Now that we have an ISBN-10 in integer form, how can we get at its tenth(i.e. rightmost) digit? Perhaps we can make a clever use of the modulus operator: tenth = isbncode % 10 Now, how can we get a that same variable's ninth digit? Perhaps we can get rid of its tenth digit by using integer division: isbncode = isbncode // 10 Afterwards, we can access the ninth digit by using the modulus operator: ninth = isbncode % 10 Hopefully, you can detect a pattern here.

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, November 18, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that determines the amount of radiation a person is exposed to, in a given period of time. Background Theory Radioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atom loses energy and emits ionizing particles, in what is commonly referred to as radiation. Exposure to radiation can be dangerous, and is very important to measure, to ensure that a person is not exposed to a large amount of it. The radioactivity of a material decreases over time, as the material decays. A radioactive decay curve describes this decay. The x-axis measures time, and the y-axis measures the amount of activity produced by the radioactive sample. Activity is defined as the rate at which the nuclei within the sample undergo transitions. Put simply, this measures how much radiation is emitted at any one point in time. The measurement of activity is called the Becquerel(Bq) . The following diagram is a sample of a radioactive decay curve. The Problem Scope Here's the problem we'd like to solve. Let's say that Sarina has moved into a new apartment. Unknown to her, there is a sample of Cobalt-60 inside one of the walls of the apartment. Initially, that sample had 10MBq of activity, but she moves in after the sample had been there for 5 years. She lives in the apartment for 6 years, then leaves. How much radiation was she exposed to? We can actually figure this out using the radioactive decay curve from above. What we want to know is her total radiation exposure from year 5 to year 11. Total radiaton exposure corresponds to the area between the two green lines at time = 5 and time = 11 , and under the blue radioactive decay curve. This should make intuitive sense, if the x axis measures time, and the y axis measures activity, then the area under the curve measures (time * activity), or (years * MBq), which is approximately the total number of MBq that Sarnia was exposed to during her time in the apartment. Now, how do we calculate this area? Unlike a simple shape, like a square, or a circle, we have no easy way to determine what the area under this curve is. However, there is a technique that can provide us with some assistance, namely, approximation . Let's use an approximation algorithm to estimate the area under the curve. We can do so by first splitting up the area into equally-sized rectangles. In this case, there are six of them, corresponding to one rectangle per year: Once we've done that, we can figure out the area of each rectangle pretty easily. Recall that the area of a rectangle is determined by multiplying the height of a rectangle by its width. The height of this rectangle is the value of the curve at 5.0 . If the curve is described by a function, f(x) , then we can obtain the value of the curve by calculating f(5.0) . f(5.0) = 5.181 The width of this rectangle is 1.0 . So, the area of this single rectangle is: 1.0 * 5.181 = 5.181 . To approximate how much radiation Sarina was exposed to, we then calculate the area of each successive rectangle, and then sum up the areas of each rectangle to get the total. When we do this, we find that Sarina was exposed to 22.94241041057671 MBq of radiation. Hints In this problem set, you are asked to find the amount of radiation that a person is exposed to, during some period of time. In order to complete this assignment, you'll need to know what the value of the radioactive decay curve is, at various points. There is a function f(x) that has been provided for you, which mathematically describes the radioactive decay curve for this problem. This problem set is relatively straightforward if you only consider the cases where the widths of the rectangles are integer values. Those cases can be handled with a simple for loop. However, if you examine the provided test bench, you should notice that some of the rectangle widths are decimal values, like 0.5 . Recall that the for loop can only handle integer values for its boundaries. Therefore, you will need to seek another approach that can handle decimal-valued rectangle widths. You should find out the number of rectangles that are within the defined region. How would you calculate this number? Perhaps the following equation would work: gaps = (stop-start)/step Then, you should create a list which has the same size as the number of rectangles, with all of its elements initialized to 0 . Recall that the multiplication operator can perform this task: timeposts = [0] * gaps Next, you should loop across the timeposts list, and fill it with time values that correspond to the position of each rectangle. For the example described in the Background section, the timeposts list would be as follows: timeposts = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] Then, it is simply a matter of looping across the timeposts list, calculating the product of f(x)*step , and summing each of these products to result in the area under the curve.

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, November 25, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid, according to Luhn's algorithm. Background Theory Every credit card has a number, both printed on its face, and embedded in the magnetic stripe on its back. That number is also stored in a database somewhere, so that when your card is used to buy something, the creditor knows whom to bill. There are many people with credit cards in this world, so those numbers are pretty long: American Express: 15-digit numbers MasterCard: 16-digit numbers Visa: 13- and 16-digit numbers Credit cards companies don't just assign a random series of digits to compose their credit card numbers. Rather, there is actually some structure to them: American Express numbers must start with 34 or 37. MasterCard numbers must start with 51, 52, 53, 54 or 55. Visa numbers must start with 4. Credit card numbers also have a checksum built into them, which is a mathematical relationship between at least one number, and the others. This checksum enables computers to detect errors and fraudulent credit card numbers, without having to query a database, which can be slow. Credit card companies use an algorithm developed by Hans Peter Luhn, a researcher from IBM. According to Luhn's algorithm , you can determine if a credit card is valid by executing the following steps: Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number's second-to-last digit , and then add those products' digits together. Take this result, and add it to the sum of the digits that weren't multiplied by 2. If the total's last digit is 0, then that credit card number is valid. Example Case Consider an example of Luhn's algorithm with the following American Express number: 378282246310005 For the sake of clarity, I have underlined every other digit, starting with the number's second-to-last digit: 3\\underline{7}8\\underline{2}8\\underline{2}2\\underline{4}6\\underline{3}1\\underline{0}0\\underline{0}5 3\\underline{7}8\\underline{2}8\\underline{2}2\\underline{4}6\\underline{3}1\\underline{0}0\\underline{0}5 Then, multiply each of the underlined digits(highlighted in bold) by 2: \\textbf{7}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{2}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{2}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{4}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{3}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{0}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{0}\\cdot{2} \\textbf{7}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{2}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{2}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{4}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{3}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{0}\\cdot{2} + \\textbf{0}\\cdot{2} The partial products are as follows: 14 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 0 + 0 14 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 0 + 0 Next, add those products' digits( Note: not the products themselves) together: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 0 + 0 = 27 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 0 + 0 = 27 Now, add the result of 27 to the sum of the digits in the credit card number that weren't multiplied by 2: 27 + 3 + 8 + 8 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 0 + 5 = 60 27 + 3 + 8 + 8 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 0 + 5 = 60 Notice that the last digit in the result of 60 is a 0, so the credit card number is legitimate. Hints Note that the credit card number is being brought into the function as a string. This means that you will have to perform string slicing throughout your program, and convert between string values and integers. Use int() and str() to perform these conversions. Luhn's algorithm clearly specifies that you must sum the digits starting from the second-to-last digit . Does this mean that you have to perform a reverse loop? Not necessarily. Think about what happens when a credit card has an odd quantity of digits, it means that we have to sum all of the elements located at the odd-numbered indexes: 3\\underline{7}8\\underline{2}8\\underline{2}2\\underline{4}6\\underline{3}1\\underline{0}0\\underline{0}5 3\\underline{7}8\\underline{2}8\\underline{2}2\\underline{4}6\\underline{3}1\\underline{0}0\\underline{0}5 Now, think about what happens when a credit card has an even quantity of digits.

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, December 2, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that encrypts a message using the Vigenere Cipher. Background Theory The Vigenere Cipher improves upon the Caesar Cipher by encrypting a message using a sequence of keys, also known as a keyword . A keyword is an alphabetical string, where a represents 0 , b represents 1 , c represents 2 , and so on, all the way up to z which represents 25 . In other words, if p p is some plaintext, and k k is a keyword, then each letter c_i c_i in the ciphertext c c is computed as: c_i = (p_i + k_j)\\, \\mbox{mod}\\, 26 c_i = (p_i + k_j)\\, \\mbox{mod}\\, 26 Note that the Vigenere Cipher uses k_j k_j in constrast to the Caesar Cipher, which just uses k k . Also, if k k is shorter than the plaintext message p p (which is usually the case), then the letters in k k must be reused cyclically as many times as it takes to encrypt p p . Example Case Consider the case where the plaintext message is hello , and the keyword is abc . With this keyword, the h would be encrypted with a key of 0 , the e with a key of 1 , and the first l with a key of 2 . At this point, we have exhausted all of the letters in the keyword, so we must resuse part of it to encrypt the rest of the plaintext message. The second l would be encrypted with a key of 0 , and the o would be encrypted with a key of 1 . After the encryption is complete, the result would be the ciphertext hfnlp . Hints In order to solve this problem set, a clever strategy may be to figure out how many times you need to repeat the keyword so that it matches up with the message. One way to do this is to divide the length of the message by the length of the keyword. Remember to multiply by 1.0 when performing this division , because Web-CAT uses Python 2.7. Once you have this comparison value, you want to determine the next largest integer value. An effective way of doing this is to use the mathematical ceiling function. For example, ceiling applied to 5.279 will produce a value of 6 .
