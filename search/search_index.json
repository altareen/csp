Her car skidded off the side of the road, proceeded down a steep embankment, and came to rest at the bottom of a deep ravine. She was discovered several days later, as rescuers followed the electronic trail that she had left behind.

On page 6, we are presented with Koan 2 , which states that, \"Perfection is normal.\" In other words, if a digital file is copied, then that copy will be an absolute perfect representation of the original, right down to the last bit. In the 1980's, when albums were distributed on cassette tapes, listeners had the ability to create copies of these tapes, using a technique called dubbing . However, the resulting sound quality from a copied tape was usually quite poor, so record companies permitted such duplications.

Easter Sunday is a holiday which falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon of Spring. This algorithm was discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss. The parameter year is the variable for the year in question. In the provided code, year takes on the value 2001 . Your program must perform the following calculations: Divide year by 19 and call the remainder a . Ignore the quotient. Divide year by 100 to get a quotient b and a remainder c . Divide b by 4 to get a quotient d and a remainder e . Divide (8 * b + 13) by 25 to get a quotient g . Ignore the remainder. Divide (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) by 30 to get a remainder h . Ignore the quotient. Divide c by 4 to get a quotient j and a remainder k . Divide (a + 11 * h) by 319 to get a quotient m . Ignore the remainder.

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, September 20, 2019 Total Points: 10 In this lab, you must write a Python program that determines the user's interest in seeing a particular movie. Background Theory You interest in a movie depends upon the following two factors: The price of the movie's ticket, in dollars. The rating which the movie received, which can be any decimal number from 0 to 5, inclusive. Your level of interest in a movie is shown by the following indicators: extremely interested very interested moderately interested barely interested completely uninterested The following are the criteria upon which you make your movie viewing decisions. Hint: Implement these in Python using an if-elif-else code structure. You like bargains. Any movie that costs less than $5.00 is one that you are extremely interested in viewing, as long as that movie has received 2 or more stars. You dislike expensive movies. If a movie costs $12.00 or more, then you are completely uninterested in seeing it. However, if that movie happened to recieve 5 stars, then you are barely interested in seeing it. You enjoy high quality movies. You are very interested in seeing any movie that has a price below $12.00, and is rated greater than 4 stars. You are moderately interested in seeing any movie which costs between $5.00 and $11.99, as long as those movies received between 2 and 4 stars, inclusive. You dislike poorly rated movies. Any movie that has received less than 2 stars is one that you are barely interested in seeing, as long as it costs less than $5.00. If any movie falls outside of the previously mentioned criteria, then you are completely uninterested in seeing it. Note that the function selectfilm() returns the variable outcome .

Task Outline Due Date: Saturday, October 12, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change. Background Theory A greedy algorithm is one, \"that always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer.\" Suppose a cashier owes a customer some change, and that cashier wishes to minimize the quantity of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies that are dispensed to the customer. A greedy algorithm is one that would take, on each pass, the biggest bite out of this problem as possible. For example, if a customer is owed 41 cents, the biggest first(i.e., best immediate, or local) bite that can be taken is 25 cents. That bite is the \"best,\" as it gets us closer to 0 cents faster than any other coin would. Note that a bite of this size would reduce what was a 41 cent problem down to a 16 cent problem, since 41 - 25 = 16 . Another 25 cent bite would be too big, so our cashier would move on to a bite of size 10 cent, resulting in a 6 cent problem. At that point, the greedy algorithm calls for one 5 cent bite followed by one 1 cent bite, at which point the problem is solved. The result of this greedy algorithm is that the customer receives one quarter, one dime, one nickel, and one penny: four coins in total. Hints There are a few different ways in which this assignment can be solved. One of the ways is with a clever use of the integer division operator.

At that point, the greedy algorithm calls for one 5 cent bite followed by one 1 cent bite, at which point the problem is solved. The result of this greedy algorithm is that the customer receives one quarter, one dime, one nickel, and one penny: four coins in total.","title":"Background Theory"},{"location":"lab04/#hints","text":"There are a few different ways in which this assignment can be solved.

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, October 18, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that determines which gene is present in a DNA sequence. Background Theory DNA is often described as a double helix of molecules known as nucleotides . Only four DNA nucleotides exist, and they are known by the labels A, C, G, and T. This means that we can conveniently represent a DNA sequence with a Python text string. A cluster of three nucleotides is called a codon , and they represent amino acids which are present in DNA. For example, ATG is a codon which occurs throughout a DNA sequence. Codons are significant, because they are markers which indicate the presence of a gene . ATG is the start codon which marks the beginning of a gene sequence. All of the nucleotides which are present, right up to, and including the stop codon are part of the gene. Example Case Consider the following DNA sequence: ATATGTAGCTAGCATAATA The start codon is ATG , and the stop codon for this example is TAA . Note that there are 9 nucleotides between these codons: AT ATGTAGCTAGCATAA TA Therefore, the gene sequence which results from these codons is: ATGTAGCTAGCATAA Hints Note that we will not consider the case where a gene is absent from a DNA sequence.

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, November 1, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that smoothes an audio signal by averaging a list of integers. Background Theory An audio signal is sometimes stored as a list of integer values. The values represent the intensity of the signal at successive time intervals. Of course, in a program, the signal is represented with a list. Often, a small amount of noise is included in the signal. Noise is usually small, momentary changes in the signal level. An example is the static that is heard in addition to the signal in AM radio. Smoothing a signal removes some of the noise, and improves the perceptual quality of the signal. This assignment requires you to smooth the values in a list of integers. Hints First, you should create a result list called smooth , which has exactly the same size as the audio list. Recall that the multiplication operator can be used to create a list which is initialized with zeroes: smooth = [0] * len(audio) The first element of the smooth list is a special case, because it should be calculated from the average of the first two elements of the audio list. The last element of the smooth list is also a special case, because it should be calculated from the average of the last two elments of the audio list. The internal elements of the smooth list can be calculated from a for loop in the following manner. First, you will need to determine the boundaries of this loop. You should probably begin at index 1 , and go up to index len(audio)-1 . Recall that the for loop has the following variation: for i in range(start, stop): This means that the loop will begin at start , and go up to(but not include) stop . Then, you will need to calculate the average of three elements in the audio list, for every index i .

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, November 8, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that encrypts a message using the caesar cipher. Background Theory The main idea behind the Caesar Cipher is to shift each letter in a secret message by a fixed number of positions. If this shifting behaviour goes further than the end of the alphabet, then it wraps around to the beginning, and continues from there. The security of this crypto-system relies on having only the sender and the recipient know the secret key , which is the number of places by which the letters have been shifted. Hints Python uses a numerical ASCII value to represent each text character in the alphabet. For example, the ASCII value of the letter \"a\" is 97 , and the ASCII value of the letter \"z\" is 122 . In order to convert between the two formats, you need to use the following Python functions: ord(txt) This returns the numerical ASCII code corresponding to the text character txt . chr(num) This returns the text character corresponding to the numerical ASCII code num . You will need to make an adjustment to the numerical output of ord(txt) , such that \"a\" corresponds to 0 , \"b\" corresponds to 1 , etc. Unencrypted text is generally called plaintext , and encrypted text is generally known as ciphertext . The quantity by which the letters have been shifted is called a key . In general, the Caesar Cipher encrypts messages by rotating each letter by key positions. More formally, p is the ASCII value of a letter in the plaintext, and key is the amount by which each letter is shifted, then the ASCII value of the corresponding letter in the ciphertext c , is computed by the following equation: c = (p + \\mbox{key})\\, \\mbox{mod}\\, 26 c = (p + \\mbox{key})\\, \\mbox{mod}\\, 26 You may assume that all of the characters in the plaintext messages are in lowercase .

Background Theory The Polybius Square is an ancient Greek invention, discovered by a scholar named Polybius. It consists of a 5 by 5 grid, in which each square of the grid is filled in by a single letter. In this programming assignment, the grid has been enlarged to 6 by 6, so that it can accommodate the digits 0-9, as well as all the alphabet letters. Each letter in the grid can be represented by the two numbers that indicate its position in the grid. The first number denotes the specific row, and the second number denotes the column. In this manner, the letter \"q\" would be encoded by the digits 24 . Even though this method of encryption seems feasible, it is not very secure. We need to introduce the notion of a key , in order to increase the security of this encryption system. We can achieve this by simply re-ordering the placement of the alphabet and digits, before inserting them into the grid. In this updated version of the grid, the letter \"q\" would be encoded by the digits 45 . Decrypting a message is quite easy, simply use the pairs of numbers to locate each plaintext letter in the grid. For example, the number sequence \"0520020214\" can be decoded to the word \"hello\" .

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, September 23, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the frequency of a particular music note, given its octave and pitch class. Background Theory One of the oldest problems in music theory is how to map the notes of a musical piece to a set of audio frequencies. Your task is to write a Python program that performs a particular kind of mapping. First, we must define a form of musical note notation. One common way of accomplishing this is to use the octave pitch notation. This notation represents each note as a number pair, where the first number indicates which octave the note belongs to, and the second number indicates which semitone the pitch corresponds to. There are 12 semitone notes within each octave on the keyboard, as in the following diagram: octave pitch representations are written in decimal format. For example, the 5th octave and 9th semitone(corresponding to note A) would be written as: 5.9 In order to map a sound frequency to this octave pitch representation, we must begin by selecting a reference note. In the Western musical scale, we assign the frequency 440Hz to the octave pitch reference note of 4.9. This corresponds to the 4th octave, 9th semitone, which is note A. Our mapping must ensure that the same note in the next higher octave has double the frequency. In other words, 5.9 corresponds to 880Hz, and 3.9 corresponds to 220Hz. This mapping system assumes that each of the semitones within an octave is equally spaced, and this is known as a tempered scale. The formula we use to calculate the frequency from a given octave pitch note is as follows: frequency = ref * 2 ** (octa + (semi/12.0)) frequency : The result of the calculation, in Hertz. ref : The frequency of the reference note, which is: 440 Hertz. octa : The octave note minus the reference note, which is: octave - 4 semi : The pitch semitone minus the reference semitone, which is: pitch - 9 Code Distribution Description File Size File Name Python Source Code for Note Frequency 1.3KB pset03.zip Contents of pset03.zip : PSet03NoteFrequency/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 notefrequency.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 testnotefrequency.py Specification Write a Python program in the file notefrequency.py that calculates the frequency of a particular musical note, given its octave and pitch class.

Task Outline Due Date: Tuesday, October 8, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the quarterback rating, which is a measure of the performance of a quarterback, in the game of American football. Background Theory The game of American football is one of the more popular sports that is played in the U.S. The objective of the game is to advance the ball into a special region called the end zone. One of the more effective ways to accomplish this task, is for one of the players to throw the ball down the field. The player who is responsible for throwing the ball is called the quarterback. Throwing a football is a highly specialized skill, and some players are better at it than others. There is an equation which objectively evaluates how good a quarterback has performed during a particular game, based on a series of factors. This quarterback rating equation is based on the following four factors: completion percentage, yards per attempt, touchdowns per attempt, and interceptions per attempt. Each of those factors is scaled to a value between 0 and 2.375 . A description of each of these factors is as follows: Completion Percentage: This reflects the quantity of successful passes that the quarterback has made, compared with the number of attempted passes. a = (1.0*comps/attempts - 0.3) * 5 Yards Per Attempt: This indicates the number of yards that the quarterback has obtained by passing the football, compared with the number of attempted passes. b = (1.0*yards/attempts - 3) * 0.25 Touchdowns Per Attempt: This indicates the quantity of touchdowns that the quarterback has achieved, compared with the number of attempted passes. c = 20.0 * tdowns/attempts Interceptions Per Attempt: This details the number of times that an opposing player has inadvertently caught the football, compared with the number of attempted passes. An interception is also known as a pick. d = 2.375 - (25.0 * picks/attempts) The following is an explanation of the variables used in the above mentioned equations: attempts : The number of passing attempts. comps : The number of completions, or successful passes. yards : The quantity of yards gained by passing the football. tdowns : The number of touchdowns obtained by passing the football. picks : The number of interceptions, that is, when the football is caught by a member of the opposing team. Note: If the result of any one of the above equations is greater than 2.375 , then that factor is set to 2.375 . Also, if the result of any one of those equations is a negative number, then that factor is set to 0 .

Task Outline Due Date: Wednesday, October 16, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the amount of money that a customer will be billed, based on their water usage. Background Theory A water utility is responsible for supplying clean, fresh water to its customers in a given geographical area. The water utility will typically charge different rates for each category of customer. Supplying water to individual households is relatively straightforward, so they are charged minimal rates. However, commercial and industrial factories may require massive amounts of water, so they are charged more for the necessary supporting infrastructure. A customer's water bill depends on how many gallons of water they consumed during a particular billing period. A water meter is used to determine a customer's water consumption. It consists of a dial that has nine digits. However, note that the final digit in the dial records one-tenth of a gallon . In other words, if the water meter reads 923874345 then this corresponds to 92387434.5 gallons. The water meter is read once at the beginning of the billing period, and then once and the end. A customer's water consumption, in gallons, is computed from the difference in these two meter readings. Customer Categories There are three categories of customer: residential , commercial , and industrial . The following is the fee schedule for each of these categories: residential A base rate of $5.00, plus $0.0005 per gallon used. commercial A base rate $1000.00 for 40000 gallons or less, plus $0.00025 for each additional gallon used. industrial A base rate of $1000.00 for 40000 gallons or less. A base rate of $2000.00 if usage exceeds 40000 gallons, but does not exceed 80000 gallons. A base rate of $3000.00 plus $0.00025 for each additional gallon if usage exceeds 80000 gallons. Hints Note that the meter's dial has nine digits and records the tenths of a gallon. For example, if the beginning reading was 444400003 and the ending reading was 444400135 , then the customer used 13.2 gallons of water during that billing period.

It consists of a dial that has nine digits. However, note that the final digit in the dial records one-tenth of a gallon . In other words, if the water meter reads 923874345 then this corresponds to 92387434.5 gallons. The water meter is read once at the beginning of the billing period, and then once and the end. A customer's water consumption, in gallons, is computed from the difference in these two meter readings.","title":"Background Theory"},{"location":"pset05/#customer-categories","text":"There are three categories of customer: residential , commercial , and industrial .

Task Outline Due Date: Wednesday, October 23, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that dispenses the correct amount of change, depending on the stock of coins in the machine. Background Theory You will write a program that simulates the behaviour of a coin-operated vending machine, a device that was in common use until recently. A vending machine operates as follows: A customer selects an item for purchase, then inserts a certain amount of cash to cover the cost of the item. The product is then dispensed, and if change is due to the customer, it is provided in the form of coins. The vending machine we will consider has a finite stock of the following coins: 25 cents(quarters) , 10 cents(dimes) , and five cents(nickels) . Note that pennies will be excluded from consideration. The amount of change due to a customer is calculated according to the following simple relation: change = payment - cost . The vending machine should then dispense the minimum quantity of coins necessary to provide the change to the customer. However, what would happen if the machine completely ran out of a particular coin denomination, for instance, the quarter? In that case, the machine would have to fulfill its obligation by using its remaining stock of dimes and nickels. Note that the output of this program should be the quantity of coins that are dispensed by the vending machine. Example Case Consider the case where a customer deposits 200 cents into a vending machine, to purchase a product costing 70 cents. The change due to the customer is 130 cents. Then, let's say that the vending machine has a coin stock of 3 quarters, 3 dimes and 10 nickels. The vending machine will then dispense 3 quarters, 3 dimes and 5 nickels to the customer, which is 11 coins in total. Your program should return 11 as its result. Hints Assume that the customer always deposits paper currency as payment. In other words, the payment placed into the vending machine does not replenish the coin stocks. Every time you dispense a coin to the customer, reduce that coin stock by one. The cost of the products, and the payment deposited, are all denominated in cents . This greatly simplifies the programming involved. You must calculate the minimum quantity of coins possible to fulfill the amount of change due to the customer. We won't consider the case where the vending machine has an insufficient stock of coins to cover the amount of change due to the customer. There will always be enough coins in each case.

Background Theory Let's assume that you have grown weary of living in dormitories, and you wish to save up enough money for a down payment on a house. The down payment is 25% of the the total cost of the house. Since housing is very expensive, it will probably take you several years to accomplish this task. In this program, we will measure this time duration in terms of months. Let's also assume that you have a well-paying job, in which you earn a respectable annual salary. As well, you have a savings account which generates an annual rate of return. Furthermore, your place of employment provides you with pay raises on a semi-annual basis. That is, your salary will increase by a certain decimal percentage after the 6th month, the 12th month, the 18th month, and so on.

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, November 11, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that validates ISBN-10 numbers. Background Theory Any book that you purchase has an International Standard Book Number , otherwise known as an ISBN or ISBN-10 . This is a 10-digit number that uniquely identifies books and media products published internationally. It turns out that the last number of an ISBN-10 's digits is a check digit, otherwise known as a checksum, which is a number related mathematically to its preceding digits. The digits of an ISBN-10 are supposed to adhere to a formula, and this check digit allows you to verify whether an ISBN-10 's other nine digits are valid, without having to resort to other means of verification, for instance, by performing a query on a database of books. Calculating the Check Digit The check digit of an ISBN-10 number can be defined as follows. If x_1 x_1 represents an ISBN-10 's first digit, and x_{10} x_{10} represents its last digit, then we have the following: x_{10} = (1 \\cdot x_1 + 2 \\cdot x_2 + 3 \\cdot x_3 + 4 \\cdot x_4 + 5 \\cdot x_5 + 6 \\cdot x_6 + 7 \\cdot x_7 + 8 \\cdot x_8 + 9 \\cdot x_9)\\, \\mbox{modulus}\\, 11 x_{10} = (1 \\cdot x_1 + 2 \\cdot x_2 + 3 \\cdot x_3 + 4 \\cdot x_4 + 5 \\cdot x_5 + 6 \\cdot x_6 + 7 \\cdot x_7 + 8 \\cdot x_8 + 9 \\cdot x_9)\\, \\mbox{modulus}\\, 11 In other words, to compute an ISBN-10 's tenth digit, multiply its first digit by 1, its second digit by 2, its third digit by 3, its fourth digit by 4, its fifth digit by 5, its sixth digit by 6, its seventh digit by 7, its eighth digit by 8, and its ninth digit by 9. Take the sum of those products and perform a modulus with 11. The result should be the ISBN-10 's tenth digit. Example Case For example, the ISBN-10 for the textbook Absolute Beginner's Guide to C , is 0-789-75198-4 , the tenth digit of which is 4 . Let's take the sum of the products of the ISBN-10 's first nine digits: (1 \\cdot \\texttt{0}) + (2 \\cdot \\texttt{7}) + (3 \\cdot \\texttt{8}) + (4 \\cdot \\texttt{9}) + (5 \\cdot \\texttt{7}) + (6 \\cdot \\texttt{5}) + (7 \\cdot \\texttt{1}) + (8 \\cdot \\texttt{9}) + (9 \\cdot \\texttt{8}) = 290 (1 \\cdot \\texttt{0}) + (2 \\cdot \\texttt{7}) + (3 \\cdot \\texttt{8}) + (4 \\cdot \\texttt{9}) + (5 \\cdot \\texttt{7}) + (6 \\cdot \\texttt{5}) + (7 \\cdot \\texttt{1}) + (8 \\cdot \\texttt{9}) + (9 \\cdot \\texttt{8}) = 290 If we now compute 290 modulus 11, we get a result of 4, which is equal to the tenth digit in the ISBN-10 . This verifies that the ISBN-10 number is legitimate. Hints Note that the ISBN-10 is being read in as a string, and it gets converted to an integer by using the int() function. The reason for this procedure is to accommodate ISBN-10 's with leading zeros. Now that we have an ISBN-10 in integer form, how can we get at its tenth(i.e. rightmost) digit? Perhaps we can make a clever use of the modulus operator: tenth = isbncode % 10 Now, how can we get a that same variable's ninth digit? Perhaps we can get rid of its tenth digit by using integer division: isbncode = isbncode // 10 Afterwards, we can access the ninth digit by using the modulus operator: ninth = isbncode % 10 Hopefully, you can detect a pattern here.

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, November 18, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that determines the amount of radiation a person is exposed to, in a given period of time. Background Theory Radioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atom loses energy and emits ionizing particles, in what is commonly referred to as radiation. Exposure to radiation can be dangerous, and is very important to measure, to ensure that a person is not exposed to a large amount of it. The radioactivity of a material decreases over time, as the material decays. A radioactive decay curve describes this decay. The x-axis measures time, and the y-axis measures the amount of activity produced by the radioactive sample. Activity is defined as the rate at which the nuclei within the sample undergo transitions. Put simply, this measures how much radiation is emitted at any one point in time. The measurement of activity is called the Becquerel(Bq) . The following diagram is a sample of a radioactive decay curve. The Problem Scope Here's the problem we'd like to solve. Let's say that Sarina has moved into a new apartment. Unknown to her, there is a sample of Cobalt-60 inside one of the walls of the apartment. Initially, that sample had 10MBq of activity, but she moves in after the sample had been there for 5 years. She lives in the apartment for 6 years, then leaves. How much radiation was she exposed to? We can actually figure this out using the radioactive decay curve from above. What we want to know is her total radiation exposure from year 5 to year 11. Total radiaton exposure corresponds to the area between the two green lines at time = 5 and time = 11 , and under the blue radioactive decay curve. This should make intuitive sense, if the x axis measures time, and the y axis measures activity, then the area under the curve measures (time * activity), or (years * MBq), which is approximately the total number of MBq that Sarnia was exposed to during her time in the apartment. Now, how do we calculate this area? Unlike a simple shape, like a square, or a circle, we have no easy way to determine what the area under this curve is. However, there is a technique that can provide us with some assistance, namely, approximation . Let's use an approximation algorithm to estimate the area under the curve. We can do so by first splitting up the area into equally-sized rectangles. In this case, there are six of them, corresponding to one rectangle per year: Once we've done that, we can figure out the area of each rectangle pretty easily. Recall that the area of a rectangle is determined by multiplying the height of a rectangle by its width. The height of this rectangle is the value of the curve at 5.0 . If the curve is described by a function, f(x) , then we can obtain the value of the curve by calculating f(5.0) . f(5.0) = 5.181 The width of this rectangle is 1.0 . So, the area of this single rectangle is: 1.0 * 5.181 = 5.181 . To approximate how much radiation Sarina was exposed to, we then calculate the area of each successive rectangle, and then sum up the areas of each rectangle to get the total. When we do this, we find that Sarina was exposed to 22.94241041057671 MBq of radiation. Hints In this problem set, you are asked to find the amount of radiation that a person is exposed to, during some period of time. In order to complete this assignment, you'll need to know what the value of the radioactive decay curve is, at various points. There is a function f(x) that has been provided for you, which mathematically describes the radioactive decay curve for this problem. This problem set is relatively straightforward if you only consider the cases where the widths of the rectangles are integer values. Those cases can be handled with a simple for loop. However, if you examine the provided test bench, you should notice that some of the rectangle widths are decimal values, like 0.5 . Recall that the for loop can only handle integer values for its boundaries. Therefore, you will need to seek another approach that can handle decimal-valued rectangle widths. You should find out the number of rectangles that are within the defined region. How would you calculate this number? Perhaps the following equation would work: gaps = (stop-start)/step Then, you should create a list which has the same size as the number of rectangles, with all of its elements initialized to 0 . Recall that the multiplication operator can perform this task: timeposts = [0] * gaps Next, you should loop across the timeposts list, and fill it with time values that correspond to the position of each rectangle. For the example described in the Background section, the timeposts list would be as follows: timeposts = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] Then, it is simply a matter of looping across the timeposts list, calculating the product of f(x)*step , and summing each of these products to result in the area under the curve.

Exposure to radiation can be dangerous, and is very important to measure, to ensure that a person is not exposed to a large amount of it. The radioactivity of a material decreases over time, as the material decays. A radioactive decay curve describes this decay. The x-axis measures time, and the y-axis measures the amount of activity produced by the radioactive sample. Activity is defined as the rate at which the nuclei within the sample undergo transitions. Put simply, this measures how much radiation is emitted at any one point in time. The measurement of activity is called the Becquerel(Bq) . The following diagram is a sample of a radioactive decay curve.","title":"Background Theory"},{"location":"pset09/#the-problem-scope","text":"Here's the problem we'd like to solve. Let's say that Sarina has moved into a new apartment. Unknown to her, there is a sample of Cobalt-60 inside one of the walls of the apartment. Initially, that sample had 10MBq of activity, but she moves in after the sample had been there for 5 years. She lives in the apartment for 6 years, then leaves. How much radiation was she exposed to? We can actually figure this out using the radioactive decay curve from above. What we want to know is her total radiation exposure from year 5 to year 11. Total radiaton exposure corresponds to the area between the two green lines at time = 5 and time = 11 , and under the blue radioactive decay curve. This should make intuitive sense, if the x axis measures time, and the y axis measures activity, then the area under the curve measures (time * activity), or (years * MBq), which is approximately the total number of MBq that Sarnia was exposed to during her time in the apartment.
