You must answer each reflection question with an essay that consists of a minimum of 100 words. Reflections This question will be posted soon. Consider the tragic case of Tanya Rider, who was involved in a serious car accident while driving alone on her way to work. Her car skidded off the side of the road, proceeded down a steep embankment, and came to rest at the bottom of a deep ravine. She was discovered several days later, as rescuers followed the electronic trail that she had left behind. List the several ways in which digital communication was involved in the discovery and ultimate rescue of Tanya. Describe how these aspects were either helpful or not, in solving the case. [100 words minimum] This question will be posted soon. On page 6, we are presented with Koan 2 , which states that, \"Perfection is normal.\" In other words, if a digital file is copied, then that copy will be an absolute perfect representation of the original, right down to the last bit. In the 1980's, when albums were distributed on cassette tapes, listeners had the ability to create copies of these tapes, using a technique called dubbing . However, the resulting sound quality from a copied tape was usually quite poor, so record companies permitted such duplications. Now that albums are released digitally, do you feel that listeners should uphold their duplication rights? Or, should there be an expectation for consumers of digital media to respect the intellectual property rights of content creators? Explain.

Code Distribution Description File Size File Name Python Source Code for Easter Sunday 1.2KB lab02.zip Contents of lab02.zip : Lab02EasterSunday/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 eastersunday.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 testeastersunday.py Specification Write a Python program in the file eastersunday.py that computes the date of Easter Sunday, given a particular year. Easter Sunday is a holiday which falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon of Spring. This algorithm was discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss. The parameter year is the variable for the year in question. In the provided code, year takes on the value 2001 . Your program must perform the following calculations: Divide year by 19 and call the remainder a . Ignore the quotient. Divide year by 100 to get a quotient b and a remainder c . Divide b by 4 to get a quotient d and a remainder e . Divide (8 * b + 13) by 25 to get a quotient g . Ignore the remainder. Divide (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) by 30 to get a remainder h . Ignore the quotient. Divide c by 4 to get a quotient j and a remainder k . Divide (a + 11 * h) by 319 to get a quotient m . Ignore the remainder. Divide (2 * e + 2 * j - k - h + m + 32) by 7 to get a remainder r . Ignore the quotient. Divide (h - m + r + 90) by 25 to get a quotient n . Ignore the remainder. Divide (h - m + r + n + 19) by 32 to get a remainder p . Ignore the quotient. The result is that Easter Sunday falls on day: p of the month: n . For example, given the year 2001 , we find that the result is: n = 4 and p = 15 . This means that Easter Sunday was on April 15 in the year 2001.

Task Outline Due Date: Friday, September 20, 2019 Total Points: 10 In this lab, you must write a Python program that determines the user's interest in seeing a particular movie. Background Theory You interest in a movie depends upon the following two factors: The price of the movie's ticket, in dollars. The rating which the movie received, which can be any decimal number from 0 to 5, inclusive. Your level of interest in a movie is shown by the following indicators: extremely interested very interested moderately interested barely interested completely uninterested The following are the criteria upon which you make your movie viewing decisions. Hint: Implement these in Python using an if-elif-else code structure. You like bargains. Any movie that costs less than $5.00 is one that you are extremely interested in viewing, as long as that movie has received 2 or more stars. You dislike expensive movies. If a movie costs $12.00 or more, then you are completely uninterested in seeing it. However, if that movie happened to recieve 5 stars, then you are barely interested in seeing it. You enjoy high quality movies. You are very interested in seeing any movie that has a price below $12.00, and is rated greater than 4 stars. You are moderately interested in seeing any movie which costs between $5.00 and $11.99, as long as those movies received between 2 and 4 stars, inclusive. You dislike poorly rated movies. Any movie that has received less than 2 stars is one that you are barely interested in seeing, as long as it costs less than $5.00. If any movie falls outside of the previously mentioned criteria, then you are completely uninterested in seeing it. Note that the function selectfilm() returns the variable outcome .

Task Outline Due Date: Monday, September 23, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the frequency of a particular music note, given its octave and pitch class. Background Theory One of the oldest problems in music theory is how to map the notes of a musical piece to a set of audio frequencies. Your task is to write a Python program that performs a particular kind of mapping. First, we must define a form of musical note notation. One common way of accomplishing this is to use the octave pitch notation. This notation represents each note as a number pair, where the first number indicates which octave the note belongs to, and the second number indicates which semitone the pitch corresponds to. There are 12 semitone notes within each octave on the keyboard, as in the following diagram: octave pitch representations are written in decimal format. For example, the 5th octave and 9th semitone(corresponding to note A) would be written as: 5.9 In order to map a sound frequency to this octave pitch representation, we must begin by selecting a reference note. In the Western musical scale, we assign the frequency 440Hz to the octave pitch reference note of 4.9. This corresponds to the 4th octave, 9th semitone, which is note A. Our mapping must ensure that the same note in the next higher octave has double the frequency. In other words, 5.9 corresponds to 880Hz, and 3.9 corresponds to 220Hz. This mapping system assumes that each of the semitones within an octave is equally spaced, and this is known as a tempered scale. The formula we use to calculate the frequency from a given octave pitch note is as follows: frequency = ref * 2 ** (octa + (semi/12.0)) frequency : The result of the calculation, in Hertz. ref : The frequency of the reference note, which is: 440 Hertz. octa : The octave note minus the reference note, which is: octave - 4 semi : The pitch semitone minus the reference semitone, which is: pitch - 9 Code Distribution Description File Size File Name Python Source Code for Note Frequency 1.3KB pset03.zip Contents of pset03.zip : PSet03NoteFrequency/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 notefrequency.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 testnotefrequency.py Specification Write a Python program in the file notefrequency.py that calculates the frequency of a particular musical note, given its octave and pitch class.

Task Outline Due Date: Tuesday, October 8, 2019 Total Points: 10 Implement a Python program that calculates the quarterback rating, which is a measure of the performance of a quarterback, in the game of American football. Background Theory The game of American football is one of the more popular sports that is played in the U.S. The objective of the game is to advance the ball into a special region called the end zone. One of the more effective ways to accomplish this task, is for one of the players to throw the ball down the field. The player who is responsible for throwing the ball is called the quarterback. Throwing a football is a highly specialized skill, and some players are better at it than others. There is an equation which objectively evaluates how good a quarterback has performed during a particular game, based on a series of factors. This quarterback rating equation is based on the following four factors: completion percentage, yards per attempt, touchdowns per attempt, and interceptions per attempt. Each of those factors is scaled to a value between 0 and 2.375. A description of each of these factors is as follows: Completion Percentage: This reflects the quantity of successful passes that the quarterback has made, compared with the number of attempted passes. a = (1.0*comps/attempts - 0.3) * 5 + **Yards Per Attempt:** This indicates the number of yards that the quarterback has obtained by passing the football, compared with the number of attempted passes. b = (1.0*yards/attempts - 3) * 0.25 + **Touchdowns Per Attempt:** This indicates the quantity of touchdowns that the quarterback has achieved, compared with the number of attempted passes. c = 20.0 * tdowns/attempts + **Interceptions Per Attempt:** This details the number of times that an opposing player has inadvertently caught the football, compared with the number of attempted passes. An interception is also known as a **pick.** d = 2.375 - (25.0 * picks/attempts) The following is an explanation of the variables used in the above mentioned equations: attempts : The number of passing attempts. comps : The number of completions, or successful passes. yards : The quantity of yards gained by passing the football. tdowns : The number of touchdowns obtained by passing the football. picks : The number of interceptions, that is, when the football is caught by a member of the opposing team. Note: If the result of any one of the above equations is greater than 2.375 , then that factor is set to 2.375 . Also, if the result of any one of those equations is a negative number, then that factor is set to 0 .
