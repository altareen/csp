## Task Outline
+ **Due Date:** To be announced.
+ **Total Points:** 10
+ Make a video that demonstrates the running of at least one significant feature of your program.

## Make a Video that Demonstrates your Software Application
+ You may use any mainstream screencasting software to generate your video.
+ Your video must be created using one of the following file formats:
    + `.mp4`
    + `.wmv`
    + `.avi`
    + `.mov`
+ Also, your video is must adhere to the following constraints:
    + The duration of the video must not exceed **60 seconds**.
    + The file size of the video must not exceed **30 MB**.
    + Do not select the high-definition(HD) option of your screencast software. Try to keep the resolution of your video at a reasonable level.

## Hints
+ Make sure that the **video runs continuously**. Your video should show the output of your actual code running. It can't just be a series of screenshots.
+ Show **at least one feature** of your software application. Your program does not have to be fully complete, as long as you can demonstrate one major feature that's running.
+ Describe the **intended purpose** of the program, in other words, the intended goal or objective of the program. You should do this by providing a spoken narration in your video.
+ Make sure that you can **connect the purpose** of your program to what is shown in the video. If you only have one feature working, then describe the purpose of that feature.
