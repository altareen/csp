## Reflections
1. This question will be posted soon.
Consider the tragic case of Tanya Rider, who was involved in a serious car accident
while driving alone on her way to work. Her car skidded off the side of the
road, proceeded down a steep embankment, and came to rest at the bottom of a
deep ravine. She was discovered several days later, as rescuers followed the
electronic trail that she had left behind. List the several ways in which
digital communication was involved in the discovery and ultimate rescue of
Tanya. Describe how these aspects were either helpful or not, in solving the
case.

2. This question will be posted soon.
On page 6, we are presented with *Koan 2*, which states that, "Perfection is
normal." In other words, if a digital file is copied, then that copy will be an
absolute perfect representation of the original, right down to the last bit.
In the 1980's, when albums were distributed on cassette tapes, listeners had the
ability to create copies of these tapes, using a technique called *dubbing*.
However, the resulting sound quality from a copied tape was usually quite poor,
so record companies permitted such duplications.
Now that albums are released digitally, do you feel that listeners should
uphold their duplication rights? Or, should there be an expectation for consumers
of digital media to respect the intellectual property rights of content creators?
Explain.
