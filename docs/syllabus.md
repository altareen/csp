## Course Location
+ **Course Title:** AP Computer Science Principles
+ **Meeting Place:** Room 308
+ **Instructor:** Mr. Alwin Tareen

## Course Description
+ AP Computer Science Principles introduces you to the essential ideas of computer
science with a focus on how computing can impact the world.
+ Along with the fundamentals of computing, you will learn to analyze data, create
technology that has a practical impact, and gain a broader understanding of how
computer science impacts people and society.
+ The programming language used in this course is `Python3`.
+ Problem sets and labs are inspired by the real-world domains of biology,
cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.
+ This course is designed for both beginner and expert programmers alike.

## Big Ideas
The major areas of study in this AP Computer Science Principles course are
organized around the following seven **big ideas:**

1. **Creativity:** Investigating the innovations enabled by computing.
2. **Abstraction:** A technique of reducing detail, to focus on broader concepts.
3. **Data and Information:** Facilitating the creation of knowledge.
4. **Algorithms:** Developing and expressing solutions to computational problems.
5. **Programming:** The means by which problem solving is conducted.
6. **The Internet:** The foundation of networking, communication and collaboration.
7. **Global Impact:** Analyzing the societal changes brought about by computing.

## Reference Material
+ **Python for Everybody,** Charles R. Severance.
This will be the primary textbook used in this course.
The entire textbook will be provided in PDF format for
free.
+ **Five Steps to a Five: AP Computer Science Principles,** 1st Edition,
Julie Schacht Sway. This textbook goes into considerable detail regarding each
of the big ideas that are covered in this course.
+ **Blown to Bits,** 3rd Edition, Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, Harry Lewis.
This textbook will be used to investigate some of the changes and impacts
that modern computing systems have had on society as a whole. It will be
provided to students in PDF format for free.

## Hardware
Each student is required to bring their laptop computer to class.
**Windows,** **Mac OS** and **Linux** operating systems are supported.

## Homework
+ Homework assignments will be posted regularly on the class website.
Students are required to download and
complete the assignment in electronic form.
Homework submission instructions will be described within the
assignment overview.
+ Students are expected to submit their homework before the due date.

!!! warning "Late Policy"
    If a student submits their homework within
    24 hours after the due date has passed, I will impose a **50% grading penalty**.
    After that time frame, the homework will be assigned a **grade of 0**. 

## Plagiarism
+ Copying all or part of a programming solution, from another student,
or from an Internet source, is a violation of the **BNDS Academic Dishonesty Policy.**
+ Any assignment that has been found to be plagiarized will receive a
**grade of 0**.

## Grading
+ **Homework:** Students are encouraged to put forth their best
effort, even if the result does not compile, or produces an incorrect
output. Students will receive partial credit in such cases.
+ **Labs:** Students will be expected to demonstrate their
programming proficiency by working through coding problems in class.
+ **Quizzes:** Short 15 minute quizzes on current topics.
These will be announced in advance.
+ **Tests:** An extensive test of the topics covered in the
section. Tests will be graded with partial credit, and carefully
analyzed for understanding and general knowledge. Tests will consist
of problems similar to examples covered in class and homework.
Students will be informed of a test at least one week in advance.
A missed test with and unexcused absence will receive a grade of 0.
A missed test with an excused absence can be made up by appointment.
