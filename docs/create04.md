# Create Task 4: Written Responses

!!! note ""
    [AP Digital Portfolio:](https://digitalportfolio.collegeboard.org/) Submit your video assignment to this grading platform.

## Task Outline
+ **Due Date:** Monday, March 23, 2020
+ **Total Points:** 10
+ Write the written responses which identifies the purpose of your program, and describes the various features of your program.

## Write the Written Responses for your Software Application
+ Provide answers to each of the following response prompts, starting at question **2a** and finishing with question **2d**. Make sure each of your responses are clearly labelled with the designators **2a** to **2d**, in order.
+ Your written responses must be submitted in a `.pdf` file format.
+ Note: I will be referring to **section 3**, which you will complete in **Create Task 5**. In **section 3**, you will capture and paste your entire program code. Also, in **section 3**, you will mark your algorithm code segment with an **oval**, and your abstraction code segment with a **rectangle**.

## Written Response Prompts

### **2a.** Provide a written response about your video which does the following:
+ Identify the programming language.
+ Identify the purpose of your program.
+ Explain what the video illustrates.
+ **[Must not exceed 150 words]**

### **2b.** Describe the incremental and iterative development process of your program, focusing on two distinct points in that process.
+ Describe the difficulties and/or opportunities that you encountered, and how they were resolved, or incorporated.
+ In your description, clearly indicate whether the development process you described was collaborative or independent.
+ At least one of these points must refer to independent program development.
+ **[Must not exceed 200 words]**

### **2c.** Capture and paste a program code segment that implements an algorithm(marked with an **oval** in **section 3**), that is fundamental for your program to achieve its intended purpose.
+ You may use any standard **screenshot** software application to capture this code segment as an image, and then paste it into your file.
+ This code segment must be an algorithm that:
    + You developed individually on your own.
    + It must include two or more other algorithms.
    + It must implement mathematical and/or logical concepts.
+ Describe how each algorithm within your selected algorithm functions independently, as well as in combination with others, to form a new algorithm that helps to achieve the intended purpose of the program.
+ **[Must not exceed 200 words]**

### **2d.** Capture and paste a program code segment that contains an abstraction that you developed individually on your own(marked with a **rectangle** in **section 3**). This abstraction must implement mathematical and logical concepts.
+ You may use any standard **screenshot** software application to capture this code segment as an image, and then paste it into your file.
+ Explain how your abstraction helped manage the complexity of your program.
+ **[Must not exceed 200 words]**

## Submission
+ Submit your `.pdf` file by uploading it to the [**AP Digital Porfolio**](https://digitalportfolio.collegeboard.org/) platform.
+ Click on the **Create** tab on the left-hand navigation menu. Then, select the **Individual Written Responses** link. You should see the following webpage appear, which contains the **Upload New** button. Click on this button, and select the file you wish to upload.
+ At this point, the webpage indicates that your file has successfully uploaded.
+ **IMPORTANT: DO NOT CLICK ON THE `Submit Final` BUTTON.**
+ I need to inspect your submissions and ensure that they are complete. Once I am satisfied that your Create Task meets all of AP's requirements, then we can formally submit your work for official AP grading.
