# Create Task 2: Programming

!!! note ""
    [Sakai Learning Management System:](http://ec2-18-179-136-95.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/portal/xlogin) Submit assignments in `pdf` format to this grading platform.

## Task Outline
+ **Due Date:** Monday, March 9, 2020
+ **Total Points:** 10
+ Write the code that will implement your software application, based on the framework that you constructed in the **Proposal** phase.

## Write the Code that Implements your Software Application
+ If you have put in a sufficient amount of time an effort into the planning phase, then you should be in a good position to begin writing the actual programming code for your software application.
+ Occasionally, you will need to refine and update your specifications. Making changes at this point is perfectly normal, and you should expect to make such design alterations, when implementing your code.
+ You should have some ideas regarding the variables that your program will use. During the coding phase, if you find that you need more variables, you can add them.
+ You should have some sense of the kinds of data structures that your program will use. This may be a list, a tuple, etc.
+ You should be aware of the minimum requirements that the AP curriculum has imposed on this software project. If you can meet these minimum requirements, then your project will receive a high grade.

## Minimum Requirements Specified by the AP Curriculum
+ **Uniqueness:** Your project must include an algorithm, which is just a piece of code that accomplishes some task. This algorithm must be something that you wrote entirely on your own. You can't submit someone else's work.
+ **Mathematical/Logical Concepts:** Your code should perform some kind of mathematical computation, meaning that it uses the mathematical operators(`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`). Also, there should be some use of the logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`). These operators are typically used in combination with `if`-statements, where your program is making some kind of decision.
+ **Subtasking:** Your algorithm must have at least two sub-algorithms that work in combination, to achieve some result. This does NOT mean the same thing as having three separate algorithms. Instead, you should find one large task in your program, that can be divided into two or more sub-tasks. For example, A tic-tac-toe game might have a algorithm that places a move on the board. Sub-tasks might include: (1) Checking for a game-winning condition, and (2) displaying the updated board.

## Submission
+ You may compose the content of your program using any mainstream Integrated Development Environment(IDE) that you wish. For example, if you are writing a Python 3 program, then you should use PyCharm.
+ However, the final submitted code listing must be in `pdf` format(Portable Document Format).
+ If you are unsure as to how to convert a document to `pdf`, please come see me for assistance.
+ You must submit this proposal using the **Assignments** tab on the [Sakai Learning Management System](http://ec2-18-179-136-95.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/portal/xlogin).
